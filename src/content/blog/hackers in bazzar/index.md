[Hackers in the Bazzar](https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.40842.fa24/) is a Computer Science and Engineering elective course at the University of Notre Dame that explores the idea of a "hacker" and the practice of participating in the open source "bazaar". 

For this class, I developed a C++ Space Invader clone, a Go-based budget sharing app, contributed to open source projects. I also completed weekly readings and developed a [blog website](https://haotianw177.github.io/blogs/) for reflections focus on hacker history and open source culture.
