At Mirastrom, I worked on the product of Miraphoto, which is an iOS app that will allow users directly book a session with photographers.

This app is built with Typescript and React Native. I implemented key components of the platform, enabling seamless interaction through innovative workflows. Ensuring a user-friendly experience from account creation to user interaction. I created a responsive and visually engaging landing page, tailored to attract new and return users, driving platform engagement. I also constructed and integrated backend end points, optimize response time, conducted unit testing.
