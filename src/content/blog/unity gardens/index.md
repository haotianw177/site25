At the University of Notre Dame [Computer Science for Good](https://sites.nd.edu/cs4good/) student club, I Led a team of 5 to develop database and inventory systems from scratch for tracking Unity Garden's community farmâ€™s grands and products.

I led the development for a data management pipeline that allow for data entry and autonomous data integration.

[Unity Gardens](https://www.theunitygardens.org/) is a non-profit collaborative network of community gardens originated to increase the availability, awareness, and accessibility of healthy, locally grown food.
