                Hello! My name is Chris Wang, and I am currently a Masterâ€™s student in the <a href="https://cse.nd.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> department at the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>. I am originally from Anhui, China and have been living in the United States for 10 years.
                I attended <a href="https://www.fryeburgacademy.org/">Fryburg Academy</a> High School and began my undergraduate studies at <a href="https://www.union.edu/">Union College</a>. Later, I transferred to <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/">Parsons School of Design</a>, where I majored in <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/bfa-communication-design/">Communication Design</a> with a focus on Graphic Design and Front-End Development. During my graduate studies at Notre Dame, I worked in the <a href="https://www.epochlab.org/">Epoch Research Lab</a> under <a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/karla-badillo-urquiola/">Karla Badillo-Urquiola</a>.</p>
